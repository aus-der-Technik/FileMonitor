# FileMonitor

Watch for file changes in a directory with a unified API on Linux and macOS.

## Overview
Detecting file changes is an OS-specific task, and the implementation differs on each major platform. While Linux uses 
sys/inotify, macOS lacks this functionality and provide `FSEventStream`. Even though there are many examples available 
for specific platforms, the interfaces still differ.

To address this, we have created the FileMonitor package. We have included code from various sources, which were not 
actively maintained, to provide a reliable and consistent interface for detecting file changes in a directory across 
all supported platforms.

## Features

FileMonitor focuses on monitoring file changes within a given directory. It offers the following features:

- Detection of file creations
- Detection of file modifications
- Detection of file deletions
- AsyncStream delivery of detections

All events are propagated through a delegate function using a switchable enum type.

## Installation
FileMonitor can be easily installed using the Swift Package Manager. Simply add the following line to your dependencies
in your Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/aus-der-Technik/FileMonitor.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

Don't forget to add the product "FileMonitor" as a dependency for your target:
```swift
.product(name: "FileMonitor", package: "FileMonitor"),
```

## Usage
### Use with AsyncStream
Example usage:
```swift
import FileMonitor
import Foundation

struct FileMonitorExample: FileDidChangeDelegate {
    init() throws {
        let dir = FileManager.default.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser.appending(path: "Downloads")
        let monitor = try FileMonitor(directory: dir, delegate: self )
        try monitor.start()
        for await event in monitor.stream {
            switch event {
            case .added(let file):
                print("New file \(file.path)")
            default:
                print("\(event)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Use as a Delegate
Example usage:

```swift
import FileMonitor
import Foundation

struct FileMonitorExample: FileDidChangeDelegate {
    init() throws {
        let dir = FileManager.default.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser.appending(path: "Downloads")
        let monitor = try FileMonitor(directory: dir, delegate: self )
        try monitor.start()
    }
    
    public func fileDidChanged(event: FileChange) {
        switch event {
        case .added(let file):
            print("New file \(file.path)")
        default:
            print("\(event)")
        }
    }
}
```

You can find a command-line application example in Sources/FileMonitorExample.
